# How to install

First of all create file with local variables 
(by default ${root}/.local.js)
and set them.

You need to specify 
```webpackHost```, 
```webpackPort```,
```webpackUrl```
at least.

```serverHost```,
```serverPort```,
```serverUrl```
are optional.

Then install node dependencies ```npm i```, 

and start webpack dev server ```npm run start```
